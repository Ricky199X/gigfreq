Concert Tracker:

- App to track concerts a user has gone to/is going to 

- User can find bands playing a show in their city/state, "attend" those shows, and see other users attending the same show

- Bands can use an admin feature to post their upcoming shows, track number of users attending, and see user profiles to connect with their fans

User Flow

Layout: Home <-> Shows <-> My Artists (stretch goal) <-> Profile <-> Log Out

User fills out form to sign up - can either fill out the form or use Google/Facebook to sign up 
Upon successful sign up, will be logged to and redirected to home page (Menu layout: “Home”, “Upcoming Shows”, “Profile”, “Log Out”
	
Home Page: will display a welcome message, condensed summary of user’s concerts attended in the past, section of upcoming shows with most rsvps which user can “quick add” to their schedule
Shows: Will feature a container with the upcoming schedule of shows based on their state, user can click on the link to open up the show details, then “attend” the show (similar to rails amusement park). Stretch goal here: implementing a search function by artist name.
My artists: User can keep an index of their favorite artists here, easily access the artists show page 
Profile: User can complete a form to edit their profile -> changes will be persisted to the database
Log out: destroys the session 

Band Flow

Layout: Home <-> Shows <-> Metrics (stretch goal) <-> Profile <-> Log Out

Band completes the band form with their information - do not want to allow Google/Facebook sign up here 
Home page: display a welcome message, total number of fans on platform, and condensed summary of band's concerts played in the past, section of upcoming shows + total number of RSVP’s to those shows. 
Your Shows: Index page of Upcoming + Previous Shows. If a band clicks on the details of a past or upcoming show - is taken to a summary of the shows details + list of platform users that attending/that attended it -> can click a user’s details to see their basic fan information. Band can post or delete upcoming shows on this page.
Metrics: Data related to fan engagement + stats of total attendance numbers 
Profile: Band can update their profile here
Logout: destroys the session 

QUESTIONS:

1. Will there be a need for an additional join table specifically for venue or could that just be a nested show route? (I think just could be a nested route)

2. Should the band signup feature a different form than the user sign up because a band has slightly different attributes? Or should the there be an “are you an admin?” checkbox on the main signup form?


- For Sign up/sign in -> could do a dropdown for a band or a user 
- Needs to be a lot of helpers and partials: whatever is unique to a specific model needs to be modularized

If user is a user -> show the user buttons, if the user is a band -> show the band buttons

OR

Probably will need an account table -> One will either need to be User or Band

User shows -> How man 

To-Do's:
Divise Gem - Multiple User Authentication Gem  -> Reach out to Dan Sullivan, research online 

Test User account: rickyrojas19@gmail.com -> hahaha
Test Band Account: arcticmonkeys@gmail.com -> monkeys
